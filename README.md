# AICW

Task1)
Two algorithms implemented,Heuristic and Dijakstras Algorithm. 
When you execute the program, you first need to enter the grid dimensions in the console. You will then be asked to enter how you want to distribute values in each cell at random or assign the probability to each number (0-9) of appearing at each cell. Then you will be asked which algorithm to perform.
Heuristic algorithm has the initial and finish coordinates already assigned. It will the calculate the path distance, show the distance in the console and display a graph to visualize how it got there.
Dijakstras Algorithm will ask you to enter the initial and finishing coordinates. It will the calculate the path distance, show the distance in the console and display a graph to visualize how it got there.

NeurolNetwork)
The neural network will initiate by reading the MNIST dataset, displaying their train and test shapes. Then it will proceed to ask the user to enter which activation function to go for and enter a reasonable number of epochs to perform. It will then perform the training, displaying how each layer was performed and printing the classification graph with precision, recall and F1 values as well as their respective graphs.

Sequential_Model) Reads off CIFAR-10 dataset, performing the training and evaluating the results. Cifar 10 has to be integrated to the task3pta folder to be read
Life_Expectancy_Analysis) Reads off Life Expenctancy Data dataset, performing the training and evaluating the results. Life Expenctancy Data dataset has to be integrated to the task3ptb folder to be read
