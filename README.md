Question 1)
two algorithms implemented. First you need to enter the grid dimensions. Then you will be asked to enter how you want to distribute values in each cell, random or probability given for each number. Then you will be asked which algorithm to perform.
Heuristic algorithm has the initial and finish coordinates already assigned. It will the calculate the path and display the graph
Dijakstras Algorithm will ask you to enter the initial and finishing coordinates. It will the calculate the path and display the graph

Question 2)
The neural network will initiate by reading the dataset, displaying their train and test shapes. Then it will proceed to ask the user to enter which activation function to go for and enter a reasonable number of epochs to perform. It will then perform the training, displaying how each layer was performed and printing the classification graph with precision, recall and F1 values as well as their respective graphs.

Q3)a) Reads off CIFAR-10 dataset, performing the training and evaluating the results. Cifar 10 has to be integrated to the task3pta folder to be read
Q3)b) Reads off Life Expenctancy Data dataset, performing the training and evaluating the results. Life Expenctancy Data dataset has to be integrated to the task3ptb folder to be read
